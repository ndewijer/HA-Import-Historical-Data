Import Toon files

How to:

Prerequisites:
- Download and install: DB Browser for SQLite https://sqlitebrowser.org/ (tested windows and macos version 3.12.2 )
- For Windows: Download and install/configure: WinSCP (https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
- For Linux: Use commandline for scp

Raw Data:
Toon:
- Backup and download Toon data  (Instellingen -&gt; Internet -&gt; Toon data)
-	extract: &quot;usage.zip&quot;
  extract: &quot;energy_consumption_tarif_hoog_st.csv&quot;
  extract: &quot;energy_consumption_tarif_laag_st.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;energy_production_tarif_hoog_st.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;energy_production_tarif_laag_st.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;energy_solar_st.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;energy_consumption_tarif_hoog.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;energy_consumption_tarif_laag.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;energy_production_tarif_hoog.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;energy_production_tarif_laag.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;energy_solar.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;gas_quantity_CurrentGasQuantity_5yrhours.csv&quot;
	extract: &quot;gas_quantity_CurrentGasQuantity_10yrdays.csv&quot;
SolarEdge:
- Call API and run supporting scripts to generate CSV, read Readme in SolarEdge directory.
GreenChoice:
- Download Meterstranden from https://mijn.greenchoice.nl/meterstanden-overzicht and run supporting scripts to generate seperate CSVs, Readme in GreenChoice directory.

Pre-modication work:

- Backup and download Home Assistant data (disable recorder while making the backup -&gt; Developer tools/Services/Call service: Recorder:disable)
- Stop the Home Assistant core (Developer tools/Services/Call service: Home Assistant Core Integration: Stop)
- Home Assistant data: 
	extract: &quot;home-assistant_v2.db&quot; (from &quot;backup.tar&quot; extract &quot;homeassistant.tar.gz&quot; from &quot;data&quot; folder)
	As an alternative it is also possible to download the &quot;home-assistant_v2.db&quot; directly from the Home Assistant &quot;config&quot; directory (For example: use WinSCP/scp in combination with the Home Assistant SSH addon).
	In case of this method make sure to make a copy of the database so that you can always restore this version of the database.

Modification Work
- Start &quot;DB Browser for SQLite&quot;
- Open project &quot;history.sqbpro&quot;. If the database is not loaded directly you have to open the &quot;home-assistant_v2.db&quot; database manually (&quot;Open Database&quot;).
- Validate the schema version of the database (Browse Data -&gt; Table: schema_version)
  The script has been tested with schema version 41. With higher versions you should validate if the structure of the &quot;statistics&quot; and &quot;short_term_statistics&quot; tables have changed.
  used fields in table &quot;statistics&quot;: metadata_id, state, sum, start_ts, created_ts
  used fields in table &quot;short_term_statistics&quot;: sum 

Table creation
- Create the 8 different tables using the SQL Query editor

GUI Import
- Import, one at a time, all the extracted historical data elec* and gas* files from Toon, SolarEdge and/or GreenChoice  (File -&gt; Import -&gt; Table from CSV file...)
  When loading in data from multiple sources, (for example: Toon and GreenChoice, or multiple Toons). The exported files from the second source can be imported into the existing tables.
  You have to create the table manually (field1, field2) in case a Toon file does not contain any data (0 KB). The name of the table should be the name of the file without &quot;.csv&quot;,
  another option is to comment out the SQL for the specific file.

Commandline Import
- Enter the database using sqlite3 &quot;sqlite3 home-assistant_v2.db&quot;
- Follow the commands found in this file to import the .csv into tables

- Lookup in the &quot;statistics_meta&quot; table the ID's of the sensors (Browse Data -&gt; Table: statistics_meta; You can use &quot;filter&quot; to find the id of the sensor)
  Below are the sensors you need to find. The names are the default names from the Home Assistant Toon integration. In case another provider is used the names of the sensors can be looked
  up in the Energy dashboard (Settings -&gt; Dashboards -&gt; Energy).

  For Toon they look as follows:
	id  statistic_id                                	source      unit_of_measurement
	2	sensor.gas_meter								recorder	mÂ³
	3	sensor.electricity_meter_feed_in_tariff_1		recorder	kWh
	4	sensor.electricity_meter_feed_in_tariff_2		recorder	kWh
	6	sensor.electricity_meter_feed_out_tariff_1		recorder	kWh
	7	sensor.electricity_meter_feed_out_tariff_2		recorder	kWh
	10	sensor.solar_energy_produced_today				recorder	kWh

  For GreenChoice, they are
  37	sensor.electricity_meter_energy_consumption_tarif_1	recorder	kWh
  38	sensor.electricity_meter_energy_consumption_tarif_2	recorder	kWh
  39	sensor.electricity_meter_energy_production_tarif_1	recorder	kWh
  40	sensor.electricity_meter_energy_production_tarif_2	recorder	kWh

  For SolarEdge it is
  7	sensor.solaredge_ac_energy_kwh	recorder	kWh

- Change the below script and insert the correct ID on the places where the text &quot;* Change *&quot; has been added in the SQL statement.
  The script basically has the same SQL statements for each sensor so in case a sensor is not needed you can comment out that specific part (for example: solar, gas)
- Execute the SQL and wait for it to complete.
- Commit the changes by selecting &quot;Write changes&quot; in the toolbar, if the script ends without errors. In case of an error select &quot;Revert changes&quot; and correct the error and execute this step again.

Post-modication work: 
- Upload &quot;home-assistant_v2.db&quot; to the Home Assistant &quot;config&quot; directory (For example: use WinSCP in combination with the Home Assistant SSH addon). 
- Restart/reboot Home Assistant (physically reboot Home Assistant or login using PUTTY-SSH and execute the &quot;reboot&quot; command)
- Validate the imported historical data in the &quot;Energy Dashboard&quot;
- Enjoy :-)


Background information:

Normal tariff meter values without correction for solar usage
energy_consumption_tarif_hoog_st.csv (hourly - max 5 years)
energy_consumption_tarif_hoog.csv (daily - max 10 years)

Low tariff meter values without correction for solar usage
energy_consumption_tarif_laag_st.csv (hourly - max 5 years)
energy_consumption_tarif_laag.csv (daily - max 10 years)

Normal tariff production meter values 
energy_production_tarif_hoog_st.csv (hourly - max 5 years)
energy_production_tarif_hoog.csv (daily - max 10 years)

Low tariff production meter values
energy_production_tarif_laag_st.csv (hourly - max 5 years)
energy_production_tarif_laag.csv (daily - max 10 years)

Solar production meter values
energy_solar_st.csv (hourly - max 5 years)
energy_solar.csv (daily - max 10 years)

Gas meter values
gas_quantity_CurrentGasQuantity_5yrhours.csv (hourly - max 5 years)
gas_quantity_CurrentGasQuantity_10yrdays.csv (daily - max 10 years)

For Toon the solar sensor is reset every night.
Because of kWh the values have to be divided by 1000.

Long term statistics (1 hour interval) =&gt; statistics
Short term statistics (5 min interval) =&gt; statistics_short_term

Short term statistics are rolled over to long term statistics.
Both tables need to be updated according to the new imported data which changes the sum column!
